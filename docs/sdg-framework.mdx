## Why We Take Action

We are at a crossroads. Despite the progress made in re-
cent years, we need renewed commitment and engage-
ment to advance toward and achieve the Sustainable De-
velopment Goals (SDGs). Digital technologies, such as
Artificial Intelligence (AI), can play a significant role in
this regard. AI presents opportunities and risks in a world
of rapid social, political, economic, ecological, and tech-
nological shifts. If developed and deployed responsibly,
AI can drive sustainable development and benefit society,
the economy, and the planet.
Yet, without safeguards throughout the AI value chain,
it may widen inequalities within and between countries
and contribute to direct harm through inappropriate, il-
legal, or deliberate misuse. It can also contribute to hu-
man rights violations, fuel disinformation, homogenize
creative and cultural expression, and harm the environ-
ment. These risks are likely to disproportionately affect
low-income countries, vulnerable groups, and future
generations. Geopolitical competition and market de-
pendencies further amplify these risks.

## A Joint Vision

As global stakeholders from governments, international
organizations, the private sector, academia, and civil so-
ciety, we convene in Hamburg to shape a human-centric,
human-rights-based, inclusive, open, sustainable, and re-
sponsible AI future. We commit to advancing AI for the
SDGs, aligning with ongoing international efforts1.
A responsible AI future must be built on equal and mean-
ingful participation, with actions to ensure that all stake-
holders, especially those from emerging markets, devel-
oping economies, and vulnerable groups, have fair and
equitable access to, as well as ownership of, computing,
data, investment, and resources for capacity and talent
development. AI’s benefits must not remain concentrat-
ed among a privileged few. We are committed to bridging
digital divides and empowering all nations and commu-
nities to co-create and leverage AI solutions and evalua-
tions that serve people and the planet.
To achieve this, we call for leveraging AI responsibly, in-
clusively, and sustainably, aligned with the five pillars of
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: people,
planet, prosperity, peace, and partnerships.

## People – Advancing Human Rights, Gender Equality and Inclusivity

We will design, develop, and deploy AI systems that
respect, protect, and promote human rights, inclusion,
gender equality, human dignity, and safety. We aim to
mitigate harm and ensure that the benefits of AI are ac-
cessible to everyone, particularly in emerging markets
and developing economies. We will strive for the mean-
ingful and active participation of stakeholders, particu-
larly marginalized and vulnerable groups, in AI design,
development, deployment, and governance.
Human-Rights-Based and Human-Centered AI
The promotion, protection, and upholding of human
rights must be applied throughout the design, develop-
ment, and deployment lifecycle and value chain of AI
systems and related data usage, ensuring fairness, trans-
parency, and accountability mechanisms for all actors
involved. AI systems should be non-discriminatory and
privacy-preserving, respect data free flow with trust, pro-
mote cultural diversity, freedom of opinion and expres-
sion, and freedom of religion or belief. AI systems should
have mechanisms for mitigating harmful algorithmic
­ biases and outcomes, which might perpetuate inequali-
ties and impact, in particular, children, women, and girls,
as well as marginalized groups.
Equity and Inclusive Participation
AI systems should be accessible and beneficial to all, in-
cluding as a digital public good when applicable, with
an emphasis on the inclusion of women, girls, children,
youth, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities,
marginalized communities, individuals belonging to mi-
nority groups, and underserved ­ populations. Accessibil-
ity should be enhanced through AI literacy and public
consultations when designing large-scale, ­ public-facing
AI systems. Participation in AI development and
­ workforce diversity, particularly in top-tier research and
AI development roles, should be strengthened by creat-
ing equitable and local economic opportunities across
all regions.
Trust, Safety, and Protection from Harm
AI and related data usage should be designed, devel-
oped, and deployed with robust safeguards to ensure
privacy, safety, integrity, transparency, and dignity
while preventing exploitation and social and societal
harms. These safeguards should be consistent and in-
clude governance frameworks consistent with interna-
tional law, including international human rights and
humanitarian law, along with clear accountability and
redress mechanisms. They should also incorporate due
diligence mechanisms, including testing and auditing,
with inputs and ownership from local communities
where AI solutions are deployed. Stakeholders should
conduct risk assessments to anticipate and mitigate any
potential misuse of AI systems.

## Planet – Sustainable AI for Climate and Environmental Stewardship

We will align AI usage with global climate and envi-
ronmental goals, including those outlined in the Paris
Agreement. We aim to mitigate the impacts of AI and
accelerate AI-driven solutions that augment our capaci-
ties to advance global sustainability and address climate
challenges while contributing to ecological balance.
Green Compute and AI
AI systems should be designed, developed, and deployed
to maximize energy efficiency and environmental sus-
tainability throughout their value chain and lifecycle.
These efforts should include optimizing energy needs
for computing, reducing carbon and material footprints,
reusing and recycling e-waste, and promoting the use of
sustainable energy and efficient water usage in AI infra-
structure, particularly in networks and data centers.
AI for Climate Action, Advancing Sustainability and
Environmental Solutions
AI should accelerate solutions for climate change
­ mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity ­ conservation,
sustainable ­ supply chains, and circular economies.
Through targeted capacity-building programmes and
support for Research & Development and infrastructure,
developers, particularly in emerging markets and devel-
oping economies, should be empowered to design and
deploy climate-focused AI inno­ vations locally.
Transparency and Accountability in AI’s
­ E­ nvironmental Impact
Stakeholders should leverage robust standards and frame-
works to assess AI’s environmental footprint and asso-
ciated risks2, including the proportionality of environ-
mental impact across the AI value chain and life cycle.
Policymakers and industries, in collaboration with other
stakeholders, should work together to mitigate AI’s envi-
ronmental footprint, promote transparency, and ­ ensure
that AI development aligns with global climate and
­ sustainability goals.

## Prosperity – Economic Growth, Innovation, and Equity

We will strive to ensure that AI systems support in-
clusive economic and social development by creating
­ opportunities that foster local innovation and minimize
economic divides across and within countries.
Sustainable AI and Data Infrastructure to Support
Economic Growth
AI-driven prosperity should be built on inclusive, accessi-
ble, and sustainable AI and data infrastructure and tools.
This includes investments in connectivity infrastructure,
computing resources, and AI as digital public goods when
possible, as well as support for underserved and under-resourced
language groups in AI training, ­ AI-ready digital
infrastructure, and interoperable ­ platforms.
AI as an Engine for Economic Growth and
Local ­ Innovation
Local AI ecosystems, entrepreneurs, and small and medi-
um enterprises, including startups, should be ­ supported
with funding and mentorship to enhance economic
­ resilience and drive industrial transformation. Local and
diverse languages should be represented and included in
AI development and deployment through mechanisms
such as licensing models that maximize societal bene-
fits and respect the rights and incentives of data subjects
and owners.
Skills Development and Workforce Readiness
To fully harness AI’s potential and manage workforce
transition, citizens and employees should be equipped
with AI-related skills through education, training, and
upskilling initiatives. Special emphasis should be placed
on technical capacity building, fostering interdisciplinary
scientific education, and enhancing digital literacy, ensur-
ing that all economies can participate in, shape, and ben-
efit from the AI-driven future.

## Peace – Integrity and Cohesive Societies

Acknowledging the close relationship between peace
and sustainable development, we will strive to ensure
AI systems are not misused to disrupt peace and under-
mine the rule of law and governance, especially through
­ large-scale information manipulation, including misin-
formation and disinformation campaigns. We aim to
ensure that AI systems are secure, maintain public con-
fidence, and are not used against the planet and people.
Preserving and Promoting Information Integrity
Through robust safeguards and methods, such as prove-
nance tracking, AI systems should be designed, ­ developed,
and deployed to protect the integrity of ­ information
­ ecosystems and combat disinformation, deepfakes, and
algorithmic manipulation, particularly in critical ­ areas
like news, healthcare, judicial systems, and ­ elections.
Safeguarding Public Trust and Promoting Safe Digital
Spaces
AI systems should foster cooperation, public trust, and
societal cohesion while mitigating the amplification of
harmful rhetoric, division, or societal disruption, in-
cluding online violence, particularly against children,
women, and girls, as well as marginalized groups.


## Partnership – Deepening Global ­ Cooperation for Responsible AI

We are determined to strengthen multistakeholder in-
ternational partnerships and foster a globally inclusive
AI ecosystem that upholds equity, innovation oppor-
tunities, and shared responsibility, aligned with global
sustainable development objectives.
Multistakeholder Collaboration
New and existing multistakeholder partnerships should
ensure that all voices are heard, particularly those from
emerging markets and developing economies. They
should also connect with existing initiatives to pool
­ resources, such as infrastructure, computing, models,
and data sets, for driving AI innovation and scaling up
AI capacity-building
Open Access and AI as Digital Public Goods
To foster trust and accelerate innovation, particularly
in critical areas such as climate change mitigation, sci-
ence, and healthcare, where feasible, AI systems and
­ associated datasets (publicly available, non-personal, and
anonymized) should be treated as global digital public
goods. They should include robust evaluation mech-
anisms, be interoperable and open-sourced, adhere to
­ international standards, and be available under standard
open licenses.
Knowledge sharing and mutual learning
Stakeholders should facilitate and fund interdiscipli-
nary research, promote scientific cooperation, and pool
knowledge resources to foster mutual learning and drive
the interoperability of global standards and approaches.
We invite stakeholders who share our values and prin-
ciples to join us in advancing the design, development,
and deployment of responsible, safe, secure, and trust-
worthy AI globally, with the goal of achieving the SDGs.
Together, we will drive collective global action in line
with the above and agree to stay connected through
stakeholder engagement, tracking progress, and explor-
ing joint partnerships, collaboration, and activities to
achieve our joint vision.
